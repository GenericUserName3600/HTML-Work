			<h2> What have a learned from these practicals?</h2>
			<p> These practicals have taught me how to more effectively create, manage and design a website
			that is user responsive, browser friendly and a piece of a work that i can now show any prospective employer in order to
			demonstrate how i can now effectively make a website. These practicals have helped me to discover different ways of presenting 
			images, text and data on a web page, while also making the web page look presentable.
			</p>
			<p>The worksheets itself act as a really good tool for the students unfamiliar with the basic HTML. They are not really easy, not really hard, ask knowledge
			 of the most important things and pretty much give you a solid introduction into the world of Web development</p>
			 <p>Personally – don't kill me – I managed to enjoy the JavaScript practical, because before that I've never actually used it. It was quiet interesting to figure out how
			 alive and dynamic the simple page can become if you add just a bit of scripting language to it.</p>
